      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

          A map displaying total annual alcohol consumption per capita in liters through size of point and life expectancy at birth 
		  in shade of orange for 2018 World Bank health data.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The World Bank health dataset has numerous attributes that could be compared with one another.
					There is a current increase in media attention around minimizing alcohol consumption to enhance longevity.
					I wanted to analyze if this tren exists and if it is country dependent, therefore, I displayed the data using the 
					map function in Tableau.
				</li>
				<li>Size of points and colors of points are two features with high interpretation efficacy as discussed in class.
					After experimenting with the color schemes, these shades of orange were the most distinguishable. I also varied the 
					sizes of the points in various visualization iterations and found a good balance of the points clearly representing the 
					data, but not overlapping one another or hiding the outlines of each country.
				</li>
				<li>The eye imeediately jumps to the larger cluster of dark circles in Europe. The annotations emphasizing 'large' 
					and 'dark' assist the eye in focusing on these trends which just so happen to match the converse of the proposition 
					stated above.
				</li>
