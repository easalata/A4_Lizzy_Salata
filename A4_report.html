    <h2>Proposition: Alcohol consumption decreases life expectancy.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					A map displaying total annual alcohol consumption per capita in liters through size of point and death rate per 1,000 people
		  		in shades of grey for 2018 World Bank health data. I considered alternative visualizations such as line charts, bubble charts, or bar graphs,
				but by using a map, readers could identify where they live or are from to see how their communities are impacted by alcohol consumption.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>(Deception Score: -2) Similar to the visualization shown below, I used a map to display trends in the data. This time I specifically zoomed 
					in on European countries because there exist many dark and large points to emphasize the proposition. However, I carefully included 
					just enough information from other countries, such as countries in Africa, to show relative sizes and shades. I once again considered alternative visualizations,
					but by using a map, readers could identify where they live or are from to see how their communities are impacted by alcohol consumption.
				</li>
				<li>(Deception Score: -2) Size of points and colors of points are two features with high interpretation efficacy as discussed in class.
					To best represent death and death rates, I naturally chose black to give the visualization a somber tone. </li>
				<li> (Deception Score: -1) I also varied the 
						sizes of the points in various visualization iterations and found the sizes of the points should be inflated to drive home the 
						message of the dangers of alcohol consumption.</li>
				<li>(Deception Score: -1.5) The eye imediately jumps to the larger cluster of dark circles in Europe. The annotations emphasizing 'large' 
					and 'dark' assist the eye in focusing on these trends which just so happen to match the proposition 
					stated above.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/image1.png" alt="" width="800"/>
				<figcaption>
          A map displaying total annual alcohol consumption per capita in liters through size of point and life expectancy at birth 
		  in shades of orange for 2018 World Bank health data.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>(Deception Score: 0) The World Bank health dataset has numerous attributes that could be compared with one another.
					There is a current increase in media attention around minimizing alcohol consumption to enhance longevity.
					I wanted to analyze if this trend exists and if it is country dependent, therefore, I displayed the data using the 
					map function in Tableau.
				</li>
				<li>(Deception Score: -1) Size of points and colors of points are two features with high interpretation efficacy as discussed in class.
					After experimenting with the color schemes, these shades of orange were the most distinguishable. I also looked at 
					shades of blue and green but these colors did not leave a lasting impression.
				</li>
				<li>(Deception Score: -1)I also varied the 
					sizes of the points in various visualization iterations and found a good balance of the points clearly representing the 
					data, but not overlapping one another or hiding the outlines of each country.</li>
				<li>(Deception Score: -2) Once again, the eye imediately jumps to the larger cluster of dark circles in Europe. The annotations emphasizing 'large' 
					and 'dark' assist the eye in focusing on these trends which this time coincidentally match the converse of the proposition 
					stated above.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p> 
		Since the World Bank datasets have so much information, the first challenge of this assignment was honing in on a message that I could visualize.
		Once I realized there was information regarding alcohol consumption, I looked for correlated attributes. The next challege was sorting the data and putting it into a format that 
		Tableau could interpret. I have a passion for promoting sustainable life 
		habits to increase longevity, so this interest fueled the decisions made in the visualizations. This passion also motivated me to continue refining the 
		visualizations through many iterations. 
		</p>
		<p>Overall, what surprised me the most was that I created two very similar visualizations that promote very different messages. 
			All I changed was one of the variables, the color scheme, a slight variation in point size, and a choice as far as which country's 
			data to include. Even the annotations themselves are very similar yet each individually assist in leaving the viewer with the desired impression.
		</p>
		<p>I define “ethical analysis and visualization” as a visualization that allows the viewer to naturally question what is being presented
			versus immediately convincing the viewer that the data and message being displayed is ground truth. 
			</p>
			<p>There are bounds you can draw to distinguish “acceptable” persuasive choices vs. “misleading” ones. I believe the first visualization 
				is misleading because it excludes some continent's trends that counter the proposition. I believe the color schemes chosen are appropriate 
				tools for persuasion. Since the first visualization was about death rates, and death is associated with the color black, this led to a more 
				naturally interpreted visualization.
