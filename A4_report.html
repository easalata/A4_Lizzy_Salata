    <h2>Proposition: Alcohol consumption decreases life expectancy.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/image2.png" alt="" width="800"/>
				<figcaption>
					A map displaying total annual alcohol consumption per capita in liters through size of point and death rate per 1,000 people
		  		in shades of grey for 2018 World Bank health data.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Similar to the visualization shown below, I used a map to display trends in the data. This time I specifically zoomed 
					in on European countries because there exist many dark and large points to emphasize the proposition. However, I carefully included 
					just enough information from other countries, such as countries in Africa, to show relative sizes and shades. 
				</li>
				<li>Size of points and colors of points are two features with high interpretation efficacy as discussed in class.
					To best represent death and death rates, I naturally chose black to give the visualization a somber tone. I also varied the 
					sizes of the points in various visualization iterations and found the sizes of the points should be inflated to drive home the 
					message of the dangers of alcohol consumption.</li>
				<li>The eye imediately jumps to the larger cluster of dark circles in Europe. The annotations emphasizing 'large' 
					and 'dark' assist the eye in focusing on these trends which just so happen to match the proposition 
					stated above.</li>
			</ul>
    </section>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="images/image1.png" alt="" width="800"/>
				<figcaption>
          A map displaying total annual alcohol consumption per capita in liters through size of point and life expectancy at birth 
		  in shades of orange for 2018 World Bank health data.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The World Bank health dataset has numerous attributes that could be compared with one another.
					There is a current increase in media attention around minimizing alcohol consumption to enhance longevity.
					I wanted to analyze if this trend exists and if it is country dependent, therefore, I displayed the data using the 
					map function in Tableau.
				</li>
				<li>Size of points and colors of points are two features with high interpretation efficacy as discussed in class.
					After experimenting with the color schemes, these shades of orange were the most distinguishable. I also varied the 
					sizes of the points in various visualization iterations and found a good balance of the points clearly representing the 
					data, but not overlapping one another or hiding the outlines of each country.
				</li>
				<li>Once again, the eye imediately jumps to the larger cluster of dark circles in Europe. The annotations emphasizing 'large' 
					and 'dark' assist the eye in focusing on these trends which this time coincidentally match the converse of the proposition 
					stated above.
				</li>
			</ul>
